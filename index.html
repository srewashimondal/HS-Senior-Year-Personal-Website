                  <p>I learned how to code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript through Girls Who Code club in school. As a Software Engineering major, I have Web Development class in senior year where I complete tutorials and final projects in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This website is created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I am most comfortable with this programming language. When I remotely tutored middle school students in the nonprofit organizations KidsCompile and Codenovate, I taught them lessons in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>

                  <p>I was first introduced to Java in my junior year of high school. After I got selected into my first choice major Software Engineering, I had to take AP Computer Science A where my teacher taught me how to code in Java. I used jGrasp IDE to learn. Runestone Academy was very helpful as well.</p>

                  <p>In my sophomore year mid-winter break, I participated in a program called Code Together in the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum. Because I live near the museum, it was efficient for me to physically sign up and attend the classes. In the class, I was introduced to Python and learned how to code the basics of the programming language.</p>
